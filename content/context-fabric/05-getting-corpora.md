# Getting Corpora

> Source: [https://context-fabric.ai/docs/corpora/distribution](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/corpora/distribution)

> **Roadmap Feature**: Hugging Face distribution is planned but not yet implemented. Currently, corpora should be downloaded directly from their GitHub repositories. This page describes the upcoming distribution system.

## Current Approach: GitHub

Text-Fabric corpora are currently distributed via GitHub repositories. Text-Fabric includes a built-in downloader that fetches zipped corpus data attached to GitHub releases, but this approach has limitations.

### GitHub Rate Limiting

GitHub's API enforces rate limits that affect corpus downloads:

- **Anonymous users**: 60 requests per hour
- **Authenticated users**: 5,000 requests per hour (requires personal access token)

Users who download multiple corpora or check for updates frequently can exhaust these limits. When rate-limited, users must wait an hour, configure authentication tokens, or fall back to manual cloning.

### Manual Download

For now, the most reliable approach is to clone repositories directly:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa.git
```

```python
from cfabric import Fabric

CF = Fabric('/path/to/bhsa/tf/c')
api = CF.loadAll()
```

See the [Corpus Index](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/corpora) for links to available repositories.

## Planned: Hugging Face Hub

Future versions of Context-Fabric will include a built-in downloader using Hugging Face Hub, eliminating the rate limiting issues with GitHub.

### Why Hugging Face

Hugging Face Hub is already the standard platform for sharing large assets in the machine learning community. It's community-driven—anyone can create an account and upload datasets—and provides a standardized API for downloading.

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| No rate limiting | Unlimited downloads without authentication |
| Community-driven | Anyone can publish corpora under their namespace |
| Proven at scale | Already hosts thousands of large datasets |
| Standardized API | Consistent download experience across all corpora |

### Planned API

```python
import cfabric

# List available corpora
cfabric.list_corpora()

# Download by short name (from registry)
path = cfabric.download('bhsa')

# Or by full Hugging Face repo ID
path = cfabric.download('etcbc/cfabric-bhsa')

# Pin to a specific version
path = cfabric.download('bhsa', revision='v2023.1')

# Load the downloaded corpus
CF = cfabric.Fabric(locations=path)
api = CF.loadAll()
```

### Namespace Convention

Corpora on Hugging Face will follow this naming pattern:

```
huggingface.co/datasets/{username}/cfabric-{corpus-name}
```

Examples:

- `etcbc/cfabric-bhsa` — Official BHSA Hebrew Bible
- `context-fabric/cfabric-demo` — Demo corpus
- `researcher/cfabric-my-corpus` — Community contribution

### For Corpus Contributors

Once implemented, anyone will be able to publish corpora:

1. Create a Hugging Face account
2. Create a dataset repo named `cfabric-{your-corpus}`
3. Upload your `.tf` files
4. Add a README with the `context-fabric` tag
5. Share your repo ID — users download with `cfabric.download('username/cfabric-corpus')`

### Repository Structure

```
cfabric-{corpus-name}/
├── README.md              # Dataset card with metadata
└── tf/                    # Text-Fabric source files
    ├── otype.tf
    ├── oslots.tf
    ├── otext.tf
    └── {features}.tf
```

## Timeline

This distribution system is on the roadmap. Follow the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/context-fabric/context-fabric) for updates.
