# Loading Your First Corpus

> Source: [https://context-fabric.ai/docs/getting-started/first-corpus](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/getting-started/first-corpus)

A corpus in Context-Fabric is a collection of `.tf` (Text-Fabric) files that encode text, annotations, and relationships as a graph. The canonical example is BHSA (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis) — the Hebrew Bible with morphological, syntactic, and semantic annotations developed over decades at the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer.

## Getting a Corpus

Corpora are currently distributed via GitHub. Clone or download the repository for the corpus you want to use.

```bash
# Clone BHSA (about 1GB with full git history)
git clone https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa.git

# Or download just the latest version
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa.git
```

See the [Corpus Index](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/corpora) for links to available corpora.

> A built-in downloader with Hugging Face integration is [on the roadmap](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/corpora/distribution). For now, download corpora directly from their GitHub repositories.

## Loading the Corpus

With the corpus downloaded, loading is straightforward:

```python
CF = cfabric.Fabric(locations=path)
api = CF.loadAll()
```

The `loadAll()` method loads every feature in the corpus. For large corpora, you might prefer to load specific features:

```python
# Load only what you need
api = CF.load('sp lex gloss')
```

On first load, Context-Fabric compiles `.tf` files to a memory-mapped format (`.cfm`). Subsequent loads skip this step entirely — the compiled data maps directly into memory without deserialization.

## The API Object

After loading, the `api` object is your interface to the corpus. It provides several namespaces:

| Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `api.F` | **Features** — Access node features like part of speech, lexeme, gloss |
| `api.E` | **Edges** — Access edge features encoding relationships |
| `api.L` | **Locality** — Navigate up/down the containment hierarchy |
| `api.T` | **Text** — Retrieve text representations |
| `api.S` | **Search** — Query structural patterns |
| `api.N` | **Nodes** — Walk nodes in canonical order |
| `api.C` | **Computed** — Pre-computed data like node ordering and level structure |

Each namespace exposes methods for interacting with the graph.

## First Queries

### Walking Nodes

Every node in the corpus has a unique integer ID. Slot nodes (the atomic text units, usually words) are numbered 1 through `maxSlot`. Higher-level nodes (phrases, clauses, sentences) have IDs above `maxSlot`.

```python
# Walk all nodes in canonical text order
for node in api.N.walk():
    node_type = api.F.otype.v(node)
    print(f"Node {node}: {node_type}")
    if node > 10:  # Just peek at the first few
        break
```

### Accessing Features

Features are annotations attached to nodes. In BHSA, words have features like `sp` (part of speech), `lex` (lexeme), and `gloss` (English meaning):

```python
# Get feature values for a word
word = 1  # First word in the corpus
print(f"Part of speech: {api.F.sp.v(word)}")
print(f"Lexeme: {api.F.lex.v(word)}")
print(f"Gloss: {api.F.gloss.v(word)}")
```

### Navigating Structure

The `L` (Locality) API lets you move up and down the containment hierarchy:

```python
word = 1

# What contains this word?
containers = api.L.u(word)
for container in containers:
    print(f"Contained by: {api.F.otype.v(container)}")

# What words does a verse contain?
verse = api.L.u(word, otype='verse')[0]
words_in_verse = api.L.d(verse, otype='word')
print(f"Verse contains {len(words_in_verse)} words")
```

### Getting Text

The `T` (Text) API reconstructs text from nodes:

```python
# Get the text of the first verse
verse = api.L.u(1, otype='verse')[0]
text = api.T.text(verse)
print(text)
```

### Searching Patterns

The `S` (Search) API finds structural patterns across the corpus:

```python
# Find all nouns in construct state
results = api.S.search('''
  word sp=subs st=c
''')

# Count them
print(f"Found {len(list(results))} construct nouns")
```

Search templates can express complex structural relationships:

```python
# Find clauses containing both a subject phrase and an object phrase
results = api.S.search('''
  clause
    phrase function=Subj
    phrase function=Objc
''')
```

## What Just Happened

When you loaded BHSA, Context-Fabric:

1. Loaded node type information (which integers are words, which are phrases, etc.)
2. Loaded the slot containment map (which slots belong to which higher nodes)
3. Loaded pre-computed navigation structures (level hierarchy, canonical ordering)
4. Made all requested features available through `api.F`

The result is a queryable graph of 1.4 million nodes encoding the complete morphological and syntactic analysis of the Hebrew Bible.
