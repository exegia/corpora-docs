# Creating Corpora

> Source: [https://context-fabric.ai/docs/corpora/creating](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/corpora/creating)

Context-Fabric works with any corpus in Text-Fabric format. This page covers how to create your own corpus from scratch or convert existing data.

> Future releases of Context-Fabric may include AI-assisted corpus creation tools that can automatically generate TF files from common formats like plain text, XML, or spreadsheets. For now, the approaches below require some Python scripting.

## What You Need

Every corpus requires three special files (the "WARP" features):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `otype.tf` | Defines node types (word, sentence, paragraph, etc.) |
| `oslots.tf` | Maps non-slot nodes to their constituent slots |
| `otext.tf` | Configures text rendering and section navigation |

Plus any number of feature files for your annotations (part of speech, lemma, syntactic function, etc.).

See [TF Format](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/file-formats/tf-format) for complete syntax documentation.

## Conversion Approaches

### From TEI XML

The [tfbuilder](https://github.com/pthu/tfbuilder) tool converts TEI-encoded texts to Text-Fabric format. It handles common TEI structures like divisions, paragraphs, and inline annotations.

```bash
pip install tfbuilder
```

### From MQL (Emdros)

If you have data in MQL format (from the Emdros database system), Text-Fabric provides [MQL conversion tools](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/convert/mql.html).

### From Custom Formats

For other formats (CSV, JSON, plain text, etc.), use the **Walker API** from Text-Fabric to programmatically build a corpus. The walker lets you iterate through your source data and emit TF nodes and features.

## The Walker API (Text-Fabric)

> The Walker API is part of Text-Fabric, not Context-Fabric. Use Text-Fabric to create corpora, then load them with Context-Fabric.

The walker pattern has three components:

1. **Configuration** — Define your node types, slot type, and text formats
2. **Director function** — Walk through your source data, creating nodes and assigning features
3. **Output** — Walker validates the graph and writes `.tf` files

### Basic Structure

```python
from tf.fabric import Fabric
from tf.convert.walker import CV

# Configuration
cv = CV(Fabric(locations='output_dir'))

cv.configure(
    slotType='word',
    otext={'fmt:text-orig-full': '{word} '},
    generic={'author': 'Your Name'},
)

def director(cv):
    # Walk through your source data
    for paragraph in source_data:
        # Create a paragraph node
        para = cv.node('paragraph')

        for word_text in paragraph.words:
            # Create slot nodes (words)
            slot = cv.slot()
            cv.feature(slot, word=word_text)

        # End the paragraph
        cv.terminate(para)

# Run the conversion
cv.walk(director, 'corpus_name')
```

### Key Concepts

**Slots** are the atomic text units (usually words or characters). Every other node type "contains" slots.

**Embedders** are nodes that automatically contain subsequently created slots until explicitly terminated. When you call `cv.node('sentence')`, that sentence will contain all slots created until you call `cv.terminate(sentence)`.

**Features** are assigned with `cv.feature(node, name=value)` for node features and `cv.edge(from_node, to_node, name=value)` for edge features.

## Planning Your Corpus

Before writing code, decide on:

1. **Slot type** — What's your atomic unit? Words? Characters? Morphemes?
2. **Node hierarchy** — What structural levels do you need? (document → chapter → paragraph → sentence → word)
3. **Features** — What annotations will you store? Consider:
   - Linguistic: lemma, part of speech, morphology
   - Structural: chapter number, verse number
   - Metadata: speaker, date, source
4. **Section structure** — How will users navigate? (book/chapter/verse, document/paragraph, etc.)

Refer to the [Graph Data Model](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/concepts/graph-model) for how these concepts map to the underlying structure.
