# Exploring Corpus Structure

> Source: [https://context-fabric.ai/docs/getting-started/basic-exploration](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/getting-started/basic-exploration)

A corpus is more than its text — it's a graph of annotations, relationships, and metadata. Before querying, you need to know what's there. This page covers systematic corpus exploration: discovering node types, features, and how they connect.

## Node Types

Every node in a Context-Fabric corpus has a type. The `otype` feature tells you what kind of linguistic object a node represents:

```python
# What node types exist?
print(api.F.otype.all)
```

For BHSA, this returns:

```
('word', 'subphrase', 'phrase_atom', 'phrase', 'clause_atom', 'clause',
 'sentence', 'half_verse', 'verse', 'chapter', 'book')
```

These are ordered from smallest to largest. Words are the slot type — the atomic units that everything else contains.

### Node Type Statistics

The `C.levels` computed data gives you counts and boundaries for each type:

```python
for ntype, avg_slots, min_node, max_node in api.C.levels.data:
    count = max_node - min_node + 1
    print(f"{ntype:15} {count:>8,} nodes  (avg {avg_slots:.1f} slots)")
```

Output:

```
word             426,555 nodes  (avg 1.0 slots)
subphrase         71,487 nodes  (avg 2.4 slots)
phrase_atom      267,669 nodes  (avg 1.6 slots)
phrase           253,206 nodes  (avg 1.7 slots)
clause_atom      115,815 nodes  (avg 3.7 slots)
clause            88,131 nodes  (avg 4.8 slots)
sentence          63,720 nodes  (avg 6.7 slots)
half_verse        45,179 nodes  (avg 9.4 slots)
verse             23,213 nodes  (avg 18.4 slots)
chapter              929 nodes  (avg 459.2 slots)
book                  39 nodes  (avg 10,937.1 slots)
```

BHSA's 426,555 words are organized into 39 books through a hierarchy of linguistic structures. A typical verse contains about 18 words across multiple clauses.

## Discovering Features

Features are annotations attached to nodes. Not every feature applies to every node type — part of speech only makes sense for words, not chapters.

### Listing All Features

```python
# Node features (annotations on individual nodes)
print("Node features:", api.Fall())

# Edge features (relationships between nodes)
print("Edge features:", api.Eall())
```

For BHSA, you'll see features like:

- `sp` — Part of speech
- `lex` — Lexeme
- `vt` — Verb tense
- `nu` — Number (singular/plural)
- `gn` — Gender
- `function` — Syntactic function (for phrases)
- `typ` — Clause type

### Feature Metadata

Each feature has metadata describing its purpose and value type:

```python
# Check metadata for a feature
CF = api.CF
sp_info = CF.features['sp']
print(f"Description: {sp_info.metaData.get('description', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Value type: {sp_info.metaData.get('valueType', 'str')}")
```

### Feature Value Distribution

The `freqList()` method shows what values a feature takes and how often:

```python
# What parts of speech exist, and how common are they?
for value, count in api.F.sp.freqList()[:10]:
    print(f"{value:10} {count:>7,}")
```

Output:

```
subs       125,282
prep        70,513
verb        50,672
conj        49,970
art         30,386
nmpr        23,077
prps        18,036
advb        14,698
adjv         9,902
prde         5,073
```

## Which Features Apply Where

Features don't apply uniformly. The `sp` feature exists only on words; the `function` feature exists only on phrases. You can discover this programmatically:

```python
from cfabric.describe import get_feature_otypes

# Which node types have the 'sp' feature?
types = get_feature_otypes(api, 'sp')
print(f"'sp' applies to: {types}")

# Which node types have 'function'?
types = get_feature_otypes(api, 'function')
print(f"'function' applies to: {types}")
```

> **Sampling Strategy**: `get_feature_otypes` samples nodes from each type range rather than checking every node. This makes it fast even for large corpora.

## Comprehensive Corpus Description

For a complete overview, use the description utilities:

```python
from cfabric.describe import describe_corpus, describe_feature

# Get full corpus description
info = describe_corpus(api, name="BHSA")
print(f"Node types: {len(info.node_types)}")
print(f"Node features: {len(info.features)}")
print(f"Edge features: {len(info.edge_features)}")
```

For detailed information about a specific feature:

```python
# Deep dive on a single feature
sp_info = describe_feature(api, 'sp')
print(f"Feature: {sp_info.name}")
print(f"Kind: {sp_info.kind}")
print(f"Applies to: {sp_info.node_types}")
print(f"Unique values: {sp_info.unique_values}")
print("Top values:")
for sample in sp_info.sample_values[:5]:
    print(f"  {sample['value']:10} ({sample['count']:,})")
```

## Section Structure

Most corpora have a section structure — a human-readable way to reference locations. In BHSA, it's book/chapter/verse:

```python
# What section levels exist?
print(api.T.sectionTypes)  # ('book', 'chapter', 'verse')

# Get section reference for a word
word = 1000
section = api.T.sectionFromNode(word)
print(f"Word {word} is in {section}")  # ('Genesis', 1, 14)

# Go the other direction
node = api.T.nodeFromSection(('Genesis', 1, 1))
print(f"Genesis 1:1 starts at node {node}")
```

## Text Formats

Corpora often support multiple text representations. BHSA has Hebrew script and transliteration:

```python
# Get the first word
word = 1

# Hebrew script
hebrew = api.T.text(word, fmt='text-orig-plain')
print(f"Hebrew: {hebrew}")

# Transliteration
trans = api.T.text(word, fmt='text-trans-plain')
print(f"Transliteration: {trans}")
```

The available formats depend on how the corpus was built. Check the `otext` feature metadata for the full list.

## Putting It Together

```python
from cfabric import Fabric
from cfabric.describe import describe_corpus, describe_feature

# Load corpus
CF = Fabric('/path/to/bhsa/tf/c')
api = CF.loadAll()

# Overview
info = describe_corpus(api, name="BHSA")
print(f"Corpus: {info.name}")
print(f"Total nodes: {sum(nt['count'] for nt in info.node_types):,}")

# Node types
print("\nNode Types:")
for nt in info.node_types:
    marker = " (slots)" if nt['is_slot_type'] else ""
    print(f"  {nt['type']:15} {nt['count']:>10,}{marker}")

# Interesting features
print("\nKey Features:")
for fname in ['sp', 'lex', 'function', 'typ']:
    fi = describe_feature(api, fname)
    print(f"  {fname}: {fi.unique_values} unique values, applies to {fi.node_types}")

# Sample query
print("\nSample: First 5 verbs in Genesis")
results = api.S.search('''
  book book=Genesis
    verse
      word sp=verb
''')
for i, (book, verse, word) in enumerate(results):
    if i >= 5:
        break
    ref = api.T.sectionFromNode(word)
    lex = api.F.lex.v(word)
    gloss = api.F.gloss.v(word)
    print(f"  {ref[0]} {ref[1]}:{ref[2]} — {lex} ({gloss})")
```
