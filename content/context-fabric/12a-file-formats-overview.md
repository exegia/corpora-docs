# Context-Fabric: File Formats

> Source: [https://context-fabric.ai/docs/file-formats](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/file-formats)

Context-Fabric uses a **standoff annotation** architecture where each feature is stored in its own file. This design enables selective loading, sparse storage, and nimble data processing.

## The Problem with Inline Annotation

Traditional corpus formats like XML embed all annotations directly in the text:

```xml
<sentence id="1">
  <phrase type="subject">
    <word pos="preposition" lemma="in">In</word>
    <word pos="article" lemma="the">the</word>
    <word pos="noun" lemma="beginning">beginning</word>
  </phrase>
  <phrase type="predicate">
    <word pos="noun" lemma="God">God</word>
    <word pos="verb" lemma="create" tense="past">created</word>
    ...
  </phrase>
</sentence>
```

This approach has significant drawbacks:

- **All-or-nothing loading**: To access one feature, you must parse the entire file
- **Verbose storage**: Every element repeats structural markup
- **Difficult to extend**: Adding a new annotation layer means modifying the original file
- **Version control friction**: Any change touches the same monolithic file

## Standoff Annotation

Standoff annotation stores each feature in a **separate file**. The text structure is defined once, and annotations reference it by node ID:

```
corpus/
├── otype.tf      # Node types: word, phrase, sentence
├── oslots.tf     # Which words each phrase/sentence contains
├── word.tf       # The actual word text
├── pos.tf        # Part of speech (only for words that have it)
├── lemma.tf      # Lemma (only for words that have it)
├── tense.tf      # Tense (only for verbs)
└── ...
```

Each file is independent. You can:

- **Load selectively**: Only load the features you need for your analysis
- **Store sparsely**: Features with gaps (like tense, which only applies to verbs) don't waste space on empty values
- **Extend freely**: Add new annotation layers without touching existing files
- **Version independently**: Track changes to each feature separately

## Two Format Layers

Context-Fabric uses two complementary formats:

### TF Format (Text-Fabric)

Human-readable text files with `.tf` extension. These are the source format:

- Easy to read, edit, and version control
- Used for corpus distribution and interchange
- Three types: node features, edge features, and configuration

See [TF Format](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/file-formats/tf-format) for syntax details.

### CFM Format (Context-Fabric Memory-mapped)

Compiled binary format with `.cfm` extension. This is the runtime format:

- Memory-mapped NumPy arrays for instant loading
- Automatic compilation from TF on first load
- Enables multi-process access without duplication

See [CFM Format](https://context-fabric.ai/docs/file-formats/cfm-format) for details.

## Required Features

Every corpus must define three special "WARP" features:

| Feature  | Type   | Purpose                                                       |
|----------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `otype`  | Node   | Maps each node to its type (word, phrase, sentence, etc.)     |
| `oslots` | Edge   | Maps non-slot nodes to the slots they contain                 |
| `otext`  | Config | Defines text rendering and section structure                  |

These establish the fundamental graph structure that all other features build upon.

## Benefits for Corpus Linguistics

The standoff architecture is particularly valuable for linguistic corpora:

1. **Layered annotation**: Morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse can each live in separate files, maintained by different teams
2. **Selective analysis**: Load only what you need — morphological analysis doesn't require discourse annotations
3. **Sparse features**: Features that apply to subsets of nodes (verb tense, proper noun flags) store efficiently
4. **Pythonic workflow**: Simple text files work naturally with Python's data processing ecosystem
5. **Reproducibility**: Each annotation layer can be versioned and cited independently
